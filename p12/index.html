        <div>All the rules must be applied only to the .circus. The rules must be followed from top to bottom, even if they cancel each other.</div>
        <ol class="list">
            <li>Make sure nothing has a border.</li>
            <li>All labels must have a size of 20px.</li>
            <li>In the form, every input after a label should, must and will be up-side-dowm.</li>
            <li>Ok, fine, put borders to inputs but only if they have a placeholder.</li>
            <li>Only the word "Strongman" should be all uppercase, just like the "JOKER".</li>
            <li>Damn, the colors got messed up. Those tags with the class "blue" should have the text blue.</li>
            <li>Oh no, the LION TAMER is hidding from the people. Make sure he shows up for the crowd.</li>
            <li>You know, we have a lot of spans in the section, but we lost some colors. Why don't you make all of those that are not blue, to have a red background.</li>
