            own in the days, there was one an argument between the wind and the
            sun about who was stronger than the other. They argued for a long
            time but neither of them emerged in the winner. It wasn't too long
            before they spotted a man walking on the road. Looking at the man
            wearing a coat, an idea struck them both.

            hey challenged each other that the one who succeeded in removing the
            coat from the man's back was the strongest. The wind volunteered to
            try first. It began to blow hard, raising gusts of air an making it
            harder for the man to take a step further. But, the man clutched his
            coat tight around him and resumed walking with great difficulty.

          <p class="letter-t">
            he wind continued blowing harder and harder, but the man held on to
            his coat tighter and tighter. And continued his journey forward.
            Finally, the wind was exhausted and gave up. His efforts had been
            futile

            or that, it was now the turn of the sun. He Looked at the man and
            began to gently shine upon the path the man was walking on. The man
            looked up at the sky - surprised at the change in weather. The sun
            did not spend much energy, neither did he apply any effort.He just
            continued shining upon the man's head gently. Soon the man was
            huffing and puffing, and sweating profusely.
          </p>
          <p class="letter-u">
            nable to bear the rising heat, the man finally took off his coat and
            headed to a nearby tree to rest for a while under its shade.
